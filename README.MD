# Spool Winder for 3D Printing Filament

This is a micropython script to run a 3D printing filament spool winder using a Pi Pico as the controller. The motor used is a nema17 stepper and the motor driver is the [DVR8825](https://www.pololu.com/product/2133).

Here are the 3D models for the [spool winder](https://makerworld.com/en/models/98832#profileId-105442) and for the [base plate](https://makerworld.com/en/models/456956#profileId-364918). The models found in the '3D Models" folder are originally from [here](https://makerworld.com/en/models/383593#profileId-283710), I have just modified them for the needs of this project.
